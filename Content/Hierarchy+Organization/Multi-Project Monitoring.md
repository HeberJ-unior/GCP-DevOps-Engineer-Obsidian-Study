description: "Customers need scale and flexibility from their cloud and this extends into supporting services such as monitoring and logging. Google Cloudâ€™s Monitoring and Logging observability services are built on the same platforms used by all of Google that handle over 16 million metrics queries per second, 2.5 exabytes of logs per month, and over 14 quadrillion metric points on disk, as of 2020. However, you let us know through consistent feedback that the previous construct of Workspaces for Cloud Monitoring was not providing the flexibility needed for your larger scale projects."
